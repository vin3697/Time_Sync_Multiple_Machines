A valuable lesson I gained during my Master's Thesis journey!

Addressing a persistent time asynchrony issue was key in the implementation, causing a delay of about 3-4 seconds between the Robot Machine and the Local System.

To tackle this challenge, chrony tool was used, known for its precision in synchronizing system clocks. Chrony is an advanced implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).

Here are some important resources, used to resolve the time asynchrony issue:

2. Tf timeout with multiple machines : https://answers.ros.org/question/298821/tf-timeout-with-multiple-machines/

3. Use chrony to synchronize timestamp on two machines : https://askubuntu.com/questions/787855/how-to-use-chrony-to-synchronize-timestamp-on-two-computers
